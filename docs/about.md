## FAQs

### What the heck is a "Call Report"?

#### _The short answer_: 

Before electronic records, computers, iPhones, and the internet were a thing, and when banks' day-to-day solvency and liquidity was dependent on the amount of actual cash-on-hand at a bank's branch: Bank examiners would call a bank without prior notice, and request the banks' manager to provide an immediate financial condition report.

The calls were unannounced to ensure that the Bank was not "cooking the books" for pre-scheduled examinations.

Despite the fact that, (unless in extreme scenarios) bank examiners aren't cold calling institutions for financial reports, the name "call report" stuck, and is the term used by government and industry to describe bank financial regulatory reporting.

#### _The long answer_:
