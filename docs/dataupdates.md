## Why Does Already Submitted Data Change

### Bank Structure Changes

In the regular course of business, mergers, acquisitions, branches openings and closings, and other related matters are updated on a rolling basis.

### New Filings

For each new quarterly reporting period, regulators receive data on a rolling basis from financial institutions. Data received by regulators is validated using pre-established error checking formulas; following the validation period, data is posted "live."

### Updated Filings

It is not unusual for an institution to refile its financial data. Among the reasons why refilings may occur are: in response to internal financial accounting errors and ommissions at the institution; changes in response to regulator inquiries; and changes resulting from previously incomplete information.

#### Identifying institutions with updated data

##### Reviewing Day-to-Day Changes

For all daily datasets, data may of course be loaded in total and individual data points compared between days.

##### XBRL Webservice

For only non-holding companies, the Federal Financial Institutions Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC) publishes an XBRL-based data feed that permits querying of all reporting institutions to identify the last date at which the institution filed data. Institutions reporting updates on multiple dates within a single quarter would, of course, indicate multiple refilings of that respective institution.
