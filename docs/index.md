# Call.Report: A Resource for Bank and Holding Company Regulatory Data

Greetings! ðŸ‘‹

This site and accompanying code repository provides resources for importing, analyzing, and reviewing Federal financial system regulatory ("Call Report") data.

## Why Call.Report?

Accessing and processing US bank regulatory data, without access to paid data subscriptions or resources, is a burdensome activity. The information and code on this site is intended to make that activity less complicated.
