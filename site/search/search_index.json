FAQs What the heck is a \"Call Report\"? The short answer : Before electronic records, computers, iPhones, and the internet were a thing, and when banks' day-to-day solvency and liquidity was dependent on the amount of actual cash-on-hand at a bank's branch: Bank examiners would call a bank without prior notice, and request the banks' manager to provide an immediate financial condition report. The calls were unannounced to ensure that the Bank was not \"cooking the books\" for pre-scheduled examinations. Despite the fact that, (unless in extreme scenarios) bank examiners aren't cold calling institutions for financial reports, the name \"call report\" stuck, and is the term used by government and industry to describe bank financial regulatory reporting.

Types of Automated Posts Holding Company Data (Y-9 Series) BankDataBot collects the daily snapshots of all non-confidential holding company data as [published by the FFIEC and Federal Reserve])(https://www.ffiec.gov/npw/FinancialReport/FinancialDataDownload). Published data reflects data fields present on the Y-9, Y-9SP, and Y-9LP reports. As of 2022, data is available for all quarters, starting in the 2nd Quarter, 2016. Data is provided as a snapshot due to the fact that holding companies can refile their previously submitted figures. Refilings BandDataBot automatically downloads each day's data snapshot, then extracts and normalizes field names and data types. The result of this normalization is then stored for subsequent review. Following the processing of each day's reporting, the current day's data is compared to the prior day. Data points that changed overnight (with respect to the Bank's RSSD ID, reporting quarter, and data field name) are flagged and collected. The changed data points (the \"diffs\") are then processed for automated posting onto the @BankDataBot twitter account. If twitter screen names are associated with the holding company, or the bank, if the bank is solely owned by one bank holding company, are included in the automated tweest. Tweet Content The text of the holding company refiling tweets contain these data points: The name, headquartered city, and headquartered state of the holding company The RSSD ID of the holding company The date of the refiling The count of data series that have been changed from the prior quarter The count of quarters over which those data series have been changed Tweet Data Tweet data is provided as a gzip-ed JSON file with the following structure: id_rssd (string): The ID (RSSD) of the holding company name (string): The name of the holding company city (string): The city in which the holding company is headquartered state (string): If the holding company is headquartered in the US, the US State; otherwise, null . country (string): The country in which the holding company is headquartered attribs_as_of (string): The date and time (in UTC) when the above attributes associated with the RSSD were collected from the FFIEC. changed_data_as_of (string): The date when the data associated with the holding company was collected from the FFIEC. The FFIEC does not post the specific time at which new data is posted, so only the date is provided. Data provided in YYYY-MM-DD format. changed_data list(map): id_rssd (string) mdrm (string): The ID of the data point data_type (string): Indicator if the data is a string , numeric , or boolean as_of_qtr (integer): The numeric quarter (1,2,3,4) of the data's reporting period as_of_year (integer): The numeric year of the data's reporting period latest_date (string): Data provided in YYYY-MM-DD format, the last reported data point as of the date. previous_date (string): Data provided in YYYY-MM-DD format, the previous reported data point as of the date. latest_numeric_val (numeric): The numeric data of the last reported figure previous_numeric_val (numeric): The numeric data point of the previously reported figure latest_string_val (string): The string data point of the last reported data point previous_string_val (string): The string data point of the previous reported data point latest_bool_val (string): The boolean data point of the last reported data point previous_bool_val (string): The boolean data point of the previous reported data point field_name (string): The human-readable name of the data field New Filings TBD FFIEC 031, 041, and 051 Regulatory Data BankDataBot monitors filings published through the FFIEC's Webservice interface , an API-based service that provides the individual filings of FFIEC 031, 041, and 051, on a \"live\" basis. In other words, as soon as a financial institution submits its data to the FFIEC, and as soon as that data is validated, the data may be downloaded from the Webservice API. The service, however, is pull-based, meaning that in lieu of notices \"pushed\" by the FFIEC to subscribers, the API must be queried for information. BankDataBot conducts these queries on an automated basis, collects facsimiles of the submitted regulatory reports, and joins relevant metadata to the resultant dataset. Refilings Refiling postings are tweeted when BankDataBot identifies a filing of a regulatory report that is updated from a previous filing. For example, a bank may file its initial quarterly report on April 15th for the March 31st (1st Quarter) reporting date, but then updates its filing, sending new data on July 15th. The FFIEC Webservice does not maintain prior copies of filings, therefore when a bank files an updated quarterly filing, the previous filing disappears. The BankDataBot maintains a rolling record of all new and previous filings, and when a refiling is detected, conducts a comparison between the prior and the updated filing. FAQs Is a reason provided for an institution updating their regulatory filing? The reason for a refiling is not included in the submitted data; the institution would need to be contacted directly to ascertain the reason. Reasons may include, errors, financial report restatements, and responses to regulators' mandates. How long does it take for a refiling to show up on the BankDataBot? Refilings should show up within 24 hours, however, this lead time should decrease as processes are finalized. Tweet Content The tweets contain the following info: Date of updated report filing Date of previous report filing Name of institution #RSSDXXXXXX a hashtag with the RSSD (ID) of the institution. Clicking this hashtag will show other tweets on BankDataBot (or elsewhere) related to this institution. If there is a twitter screen name associated with the institution, that name is included in the tweet. The name of the refiled report (031, 041, or 051) The number of data series changed between the refiled report and the last filed report. A link to a gzipped-JSON file containing the original filing, updated filing, and changed data fields. Tweet Data Each refiling contains a link to the source data from which the tweet text was generated. The gzipped JSON file may be decompressed natively in a Linux-based OS or MacOS. Windows users can use the 7-Zip utility to decompress the file. The JSON file is a machine-readable file; however, Firefox is recommended for a human-friendly hierarchial interface to explore file content. Schema: id_rssd (integer): The FFIEC-assigned identification number for the reporting financial institution. bank_name (string): The legal name of the bank, as recorded by the FFIEC. This name may be slightly different from the \"human-friendly\" name included in the tweet text. city (string): The city of the institution's headquarters state (string): The two-character Postal Service U.S. state code indicating the location of the bank's headquarters. as_of_quarter (int): The reporting quarter referenced by the filing. 1 = 1st Quarter ending on 3/31, 4 = 4th Quarter ending on 12/31. as_of_year (int): The 4-digit reporting year rpt_name (string): The name of the report filed by the respective institution. Options are FFIEC 031 , FFIEC 041 , FFIEC 051 . last_filing_date (string): The timestamp for the date and time of the refiling in `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM Z\" format. Note that the timestamp timezone is shifted to UTC from the native time zone in Washington, DC. previous_filing_date (string): The timestamp for the immediately previous filed financial data, in the same format as the last_filing_date. latest_data & previous_data ( list[map] ): The regulatory filing data collected with the latest filing, and the regulatory data filing from the prior filing, respectively. mdrm (string): The ID of data field rssd (string): The ID (RSSD) of the reporting institution quarter (string): The institution's reporting quarter in MM/DD/YYYY format. The MM/DD will have the values of 3/31 , 6/30 , 9/30 , or 12/31 . int_data (integer): If the data series reports data in integer format, this field will contain that value. float_data (float / double): If the data series reports data as a floating point (double) format, this field will contain that value. bool_data (boolean): If the data series reports data in boolean format, this field will contain that value. str_data (string): If the data series reports data in string format, this field will contain that value. data_type (string): Indicates if the data series reports an int , float , bool , or str value. field_name (string): The name of the data field, as reported by the MDRM Data Dictionary. changed_fields ( list[map] ): ...same fields as prior, with latest or prior appended to the respective data fields. change_type (string): Indicates the name of the data schema; will always be the value refiling New Filings TBA General FAQs Why is the output data between the bank and the holding company filings different? The source data provided by the FFIEC for banks and for holding companies have different formats and metadata. While some effort has been taken to normalize the output datasets between the two sources, more work is needed. Eventually, the output data should be the same. Where can I find information on updates to the format or content of tweet text or data ? The twitter account @BankDataBotKeep will post the latest announcements related to the BankDataBot. Can I download a bulk version of the tweets or output data? Yes, bulk data download is available as a service. Please contact michael@civicobj.com to inquire. Is an alternative distribution method available available for the content contained in the tweets? Yes, alternative distribution, including webhooks, Kafka endpoints, or AWS SQS queues, methods are available as a service.

For purposes of identifying the financial institutions to which a time series referred - or to filter time series data by particular attributes of financial institutions - the structural/attribute data may be merged or joined with the time series data. The Basics Each and every financial company, branch, related institution, and subsidiary regulated by the Federal Reserve is assigned an \"RSSD\", an integer number no longer than 10 characters. The RSSD number itself does not contain any semantic data - the number, or digit positions do not represent any data that describes the institution itself. Mergers, Acquisitions, and Resolutions The RSSD assigned a bank branch, institution, or other organizational component remains the same throughout any merger or acquisition transaction, as long as the respective entity is a \"survivor\" of the transaction. Once an RSSD is utilized for an entity, the RSSD is not reused. Relationship to Other Regulators Identification Schemes While the RSSD is the most prevalent and comprehensive identification scheme (with respect to the count and breadth of institutions covered), other Federal regulatory agencies use other institution identification schemes: Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) For depository institutions (banks), the FDIC uses \"certificate\" numbers; this number represents the number assigned to the deposit insurance certificate granted to the bank. For all financial data reported by the FDIC, this ID, indicated at the CERT field, is the primary institution ID. The Federal Reserve's attribute data does includes a crosswalk to the FDIC certificate number. Bank Branches For bank branches, the FDIC also assigns a branch number , whose value is a sequential integer, and a UNINUM , a unique integer number assigned to the branch by the FDIC. There is no publicly available crosswalk between the FDIC branch UNINUM and the RSSD assigned by the Federal Reserve to the respective branch. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) also uses a separate ID numbering scheme, known as the OCC ID . Data Acquisition and Analysis The ATTRIBUTES Files The Federal Reserve tracks changes to the corporate structure of financial institutions, their branches, subsidiaries, related entities, and holding companies, (\"entities\") on a continuous basis in an internal transaction table known as the ATTRIBUTES record. Each row in this table indicates an initial or changed structural characteristic, such as (but not limited to): The type and charter of the respective entity The termination date of a now-closed entity The physical location of the entity The \"parent\" company that owns the entity From their internal source data, the Federal Reserve publishes daily extracts at this link Data Dictionaries Data Dictionaries and other supporting resources are available on github.com/call-report/data-resources Analysis Note Note that the Federal Reserve does not publish the full record of the ATTRIBUTES file on its public website; this data is only available via a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request. Without the full record, an analyst cannot track the progression of changes and updates to an organization's attribute record - the daily extracts publicly provided by the Federal Reserve only indicate the last recorded set of attributed for the respective institution. Active Attributes Lists the daily extract of the ATTRIBUTES record for all institutions that are going concerns (active, and in business). Closed Attributes Lists the daily extract of the ATTRIBUTES record for all institutions that are no longer going concerns. Branches Lists characteristics of bank branches; note that this bank branch information does not include a crosswalk to the FDIC's UNINUM . This lack of a crosswalk is an impediment to matching the FDIC's Summary of Deposits data with the FDIC's Branch Data Transformations Lists mergers and acquisitions of one financial institution to another, through providing the RSSD IDs of the survivor and non-acquired institution. This list of relationships (graph edges) can be utilized to construct a graph that represents each institutions' relationship to one another. Relationships Lists each entity's relationship to another, with respect to if an institution is owned or owns another institution. Important Note when Analyzing Relationship Data Note that institutions may not 100% own other institutions; a child subsidiary of an institution may be owned by more than one parent entity.","title":"Attributes Data"},{"location":"datasources/attributes/#metadata-and-structural-attributes-of-federal-reserve-regulated-institutions","text":"Non-financial information about financial institutions regulated by the Federal Reserve is often referred to as \"structural\" or \"attribute\" data.

Some data, particularly for smaller financial institutions' data is semi-annual. Publishing frequency Regulatory agencies receive data on a rolling basis. Bulk data downloads are updated approximately monthly \"Webservice\" feeds are updated soon after bank regulatory filings are submitted and validated. (A Python-based wrapper for these feeds is available at https://pypi.org/project/ffiec-data-connect) Data Fields and Data Dictionaries Time series are published by field name (an \"MDRM\"), the ID of the reporting institution, and the reporting date (typically quarterly). The data release date is not included in the datasets themselves, but can be inferred from the data publication data. The data dictionaries describing MDRM fields is available at: https://www.federalreserve.gov/apps/mdrm/pdf/MDRM.zip , and are updated daily. Scripts to download and transform the MDRM data dictionaries are available in the Code Library Institution Identifiers Overview Federal Reserve and FFIEC Institution Identifiers Federal Reserve institution identifiers are known as \"RSSD\" Ids. Bank regulatory data referenced on this page uses these RSSDs as the primary identifiers for financial institutions. Matching RSSD Identifiers to Institution Names TBD Taxonomies \"CDR Taxonomies,\" also known as \"Call Report Taxonomies,\" represent the relationship of data points within bank regulatory data among each other. Details As noted earlier, bank regulatory time series data points are characterized by: The ID of the reporting institution (RSSD) The time period represented by the data point The data series reported (MDRM) The release date of the data Within these dimensions, for each reporting quarter, taxonomies are published by the FFIEC that indicate the \"Schedule\", \"Section\", \"Line\", and in some cases, \"Column\" of the data. These hierarchical categories facilitate an analysts' understanding of the financial condition of an organization. For example, in the FFIEC 031 report: Schedule: RC-B (Report of Condition - Part B - Securities) Line: 1 Column C: The Amortized Cost of Available-for Sale Treasury Securities (MDRM: RCFD1286) Column D: The Fair Value of Available-for-Sale Treasury Securities (MDRM: RCFD1287) Current and historical forms may be downloaded from the FFIEC: - FFIEC 031 : Consolidated Reports of Condition and Income for a Bank with Domestic and Foreign Offices - FFIEC 041 : Consolidated Reports of Condition and Income for a Bank with Domestic Offices Only - FFIEC 051 : Consolidated Reports of Condition and Income for a Bank with Domestic Offices Only and Total Assets Less than $5 Billion Note that a data series may be shared by one or more of the above reports. Download Locations While taxonomies may be reviewed from the PDFs above, the PDFs do not provide a machine data format for purposes of programmatic data analysis. Machine-data version of the taxonomies may be downloaded from https://cdr.ffiec.gov/public/DownloadTaxonomy.aspx Taxonomies are provided in XBRL format, which typically requires commercial software for processing. In lieu of this commercial software, a Python-based tool for converting CDR taxonomies to JSON format is available here . Sources Time Series 2001 - present Bulk Data Downloads Historical data is provided from 2001 until the present day by the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC). Bulk data downloads are generated from the rolling filings on monthly basis, typically released mid-month. Data is provided in XBRL and CSV format. The permanent lnk to download bulk regulatory data is available at https://cdr.ffiec.gov/public/PWS/DownloadBulkData.aspx Webservice Access TBD Historical Timeseries 1978 - 2010 (Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago) Historical bank regulatory data is provided by the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago (the \"Chicago\" dataset) at two links: 1976-2000: https://www.chicagofed.org/banking/financial-institution-reports/commercial-bank-data-complete-1976-2000 2000-2010: https://www.chicagofed.org/banking/financial-institution-reports/commercial-bank-data-complete-2001-2010 Importing and Processing Data Series These time series data are provided as zipped SAS XPORT files; SAS or the python library pyreadstat may be utilized to import the data. scripts-toolkit A python-based tool, sas_xport_converter , is available in the scripts-toolkit repo at https://github.com/call-report/scripts-toolkit to ingest the source files, re-encode character data to UTF-8, identify field types, and normalize the data for purposes of further analysis. This tool will eventually be incorporated into the data-converter service. Integrating the \"Chicago\" dataset with the \"Bulk Data Downloads\" dataset The historical Chicago dataset overlaps with the FFIEC \"bulk\" dataset. The sas_xport_converter tool normalizes the historical dataset to make easier the process of integrating the datasets together. Note that the Chicago dataset contains institution structural data that are not present in the \"bulk\" dataset. Both the Chicago dataset and the bulk dataset may be joined with the FFIEC Attributes dataset.
