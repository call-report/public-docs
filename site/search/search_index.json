FAQs What the heck is a \"Call Report\"? The short answer : Before electronic records, computers, iPhones, and the internet were a thing, and when banks' day-to-day solvency and liquidity was dependent on the amount of actual cash-on-hand at a bank's branch: Bank examiners would call a bank without prior notice, and request the banks' manager to provide an immediate financial condition report. The calls were unannounced to ensure that the Bank was not \"cooking the books\" for pre-scheduled examinations. Despite the fact that, (unless in extreme scenarios) bank examiners aren't cold calling institutions for financial reports, the name \"call report\" stuck, and is the term used by government and industry to describe bank financial regulatory reporting. The long answer : Check out the Wikipedia entry \ud83d\udc49 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_report Why call.report? It's quite a nifty domain name, eh?

For purposes of identifying the financial institutions to which a time series referred - or to filter time series data by particular attributes of financial institutions - the structural/attribute data may be merged or joined with the time series data. The Basics Each and every financial company, branch, related institution, and subsidiary regulated by the Federal Reserve is assigned an \"RSSD\", an integer number no longer than 10 characters. The RSSD number itself does not contain any semantic data - the number, or digit positions do not represent any data that describes the institution itself. Mergers, Acquisitions, and Resolutions The RSSD assigned a bank branch, institution, or other organizational component remains the same throughout any merger or acquisition transaction, as long as the respective entity is a \"survivor\" of the transaction. Once an RSSD is utilized for an entity, the RSSD is not reused. Relationship to Other Regulators Identification Schemes While the RSSD is the most prevalent and comprehensive identification scheme (with respect to the count and breadth of institutions covered), other Federal regulatory agencies use other institution identification schemes: Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) For depository institutions (banks), the FDIC uses \"certificate\" numbers; this number represents the number assigned to the deposit insurance certificate granted to the bank. For all financial data reported by the FDIC, this ID, indicated at the CERT field, is the primary institution ID. The Federal Reserve's attribute data does includes a crosswalk to the FDIC certificate number. Bank Branches For bank branches, the FDIC also assigns a branch number , whose value is a sequential integer, and a UNINUM , a unique integer number assigned to the branch by the FDIC. There is no publicly available crosswalk between the FDIC branch UNINUM and the RSSD assigned by the Federal Reserve to the respective branch. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) also uses a separate ID numbering scheme, known as the OCC ID . Data Acquisition and Analysis The ATTRIBUTES Files The Federal Reserve tracks changes to the corporate structure of financial institutions, their branches, subsidiaries, related entities, and holding companies, (\"entities\") on a continuous basis in an internal transaction table known as the ATTRIBUTES record. Each row in this table indicates an initial or changed structural characteristic, such as (but not limited to): The type and charter of the respective entity The termination date of a now-closed entity The physical location of the entity The \"parent\" company that owns the entity From their internal source data, the Federal Reserve publishes daily extracts at this link Data Dictionaries Data Dictionaries and other supporting resources are available on github.com/call-report/data-resources Analysis Note Note that the Federal Reserve does not publish the full record of the ATTRIBUTES file on its public website; this data is only available via a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request. Without the full record, an analyst cannot track the progression of changes and updates to an organization's attribute record - the daily extracts publicly provided by the Federal Reserve only indicate the last recorded set of attributed for the respective institution. Active Attributes Lists the daily extract of the ATTRIBUTES record for all institutions that are going concerns (active, and in business). Closed Attributes Lists the daily extract of the ATTRIBUTES record for all institutions that are no longer going concerns. Branches Lists characteristics of bank branches; note that this bank branch information does not include a crosswalk to the FDIC's UNINUM . This lack of a crosswalk is an impediment to matching the FDIC's Summary of Deposits data with the FDIC's Branch Data Transformations Lists mergers and acquisitions of one financial institution to another, through providing the RSSD IDs of the survivor and non-acquired institution. This list of relationships (graph edges) can be utilized to construct a graph that represents each institutions' relationship to one another. Relationships Lists each entity's relationship to another, with respect to if an institution is owned or owns another institution. Important Note when Analyzing Relationship Data Note that institutions may not 100% own other institutions; a child subsidiary of an institution may be owned by more than one parent entity.","title":"Attributes Data"},{"location":"datasources/attributes/#metadata-and-structural-attributes-of-federal-reserve-regulated-institutions","text":"Non-financial information about financial institutions regulated by the Federal Reserve is often referred to as \"structural\" or \"attribute\" data.

Some data, particularly for smaller financial institutions' data is semi-annual. Publishing frequency Regulatory agencies receive data on a rolling basis. Bulk data downloads are updated approximately monthly, while \"webservice\" feeds are updated soon after bank regulatory filings are submitted and validated. Data Fields and Data Dictionaries Time series are published by field name (an \"MDRM\"), the ID of the reporting institution, and the reporting date (typically quarterly). The data release date is not included in the datasets themselves, but can be inferred from the data publication data. The data dictionaries describing MDRM fields is available at: https://www.federalreserve.gov/apps/mdrm/pdf/MDRM.zip , and are updated daily. Scripts to download and transform the MDRM data dictionaries are available in the Code Library Institution Identifiers Overview Federal Reserve and FFIEC Institution Identifiers Federal Reserve institution identifiers are known as \"RSSD\" Ids. Bank regulatory data referenced on this page uses these RSSDs as the primary identifiers for financial institutions. Matching RSSD Identifiers to Institution Names TBD Taxonomies \"CDR Taxonomies,\" also known as \"Call Report Taxonomies,\" represent the relationship of data points within bank regulatory data among each other. Details As noted earlier, bank regulatory time series data points are characterized by: The ID of the reporting institution (RSSD) The time period represented by the data point The data series reported (MDRM) The release date of the data Within these dimensions, for each reporting quarter, taxonomies are published by the FFIEC that indicate the \"Schedule\", \"Section\", \"Line\", and in some cases, \"Column\" of the data. These hierarchical categories facilitate an analysts' understanding of the financial condition of an organization. For example, in the FFIEC 031 report: Schedule: RC-B (Report of Condition - Part B - Securities) Line: 1 Column C: The Amortized Cost of Available-for Sale Treasury Securities (MDRM: RCFD1286) Column D: The Fair Value of Available-for-Sale Treasury Securities (MDRM: RCFD1287) Current and historical forms may be downloaded from the FFIEC: - FFIEC 031 : Consolidated Reports of Condition and Income for a Bank with Domestic and Foreign Offices - FFIEC 041 : Consolidated Reports of Condition and Income for a Bank with Domestic Offices Only - FFIEC 051 : Consolidated Reports of Condition and Income for a Bank with Domestic Offices Only and Total Assets Less than $5 Billion Note that a data series may be shared by one or more of the above reports. Download Locations While taxonomies may be reviewed from the PDFs above, the PDFs do not provide a machine data format for purposes of programmatic data analysis. Machine-data version of the taxonomies may be downloaded from https://cdr.ffiec.gov/public/DownloadTaxonomy.aspx Taxonomies are provided in XBRL format, which typically requires commercial software for processing. In lieu of this commercial software, a Python-based tool for converting CDR taxonomies to JSON format is available here . Sources Time Series 2001 - present Bulk Data Downloads Historical data is provided from 2001 until the present day by the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC). Bulk data downloads are generated from the rolling filings on monthly basis, typically released mid-month. Data is provided in XBRL and CSV format.

This tool will eventually be incorporated into the data-converter service. Integrating the \"Chicago\" dataset with the \"Bulk Data Downloads\" dataset The historical Chicago dataset overlaps with the FFIEC \"bulk\" dataset. The sas_xport_converter tool normalizes the historical dataset to make easier the process of integrating the datasets together. Note that the Chicago dataset contains institution structural data that are not present in the \"bulk\" dataset. Both the Chicago dataset and the bulk dataset may be joined with the FFIEC Attributes dataset. The attributes data includes the structural data that would otherwise be included in the Chicago data.","title":"Bank Time Series Regulatory Data"},{"location":"datasources/banktimeseries/#bank-time-series-regulatory-data","text":"","title":"Bank Time Series Regulatory Data"},{"location":"datasources/banktimeseries/#about","text":"","title":"About"},{"location":"datasources/banktimeseries/#time-series-frequency","text":"Most all public bank regulatory data is time series data with a quarterly frequency.
